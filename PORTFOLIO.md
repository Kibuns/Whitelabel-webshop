##### Research


###### 1. Why am i using React for this project?

The reason i use React for this project is because i want to learn it for the future. 1 goal of mine is too learn mobile development and react native is a good thing to master if i wanna go that route one day. I can acomplish this goal easier if i used React before. So this is my main reason to use React in this semester.

###### 2. SQl or NoSQL database?

By doing some research about SQl or NoSQL i came to a conclusion. For my application (webshop) the best choice is to use a SQL-database. This is a good choice because my data is structured. A good project to have a NoSQL database is for example twitter where your data is all random. The plan for this project is to make 3 databases each related to 1 thing. So for example i would have 1 database for products only. This makes it single responsibility too.
